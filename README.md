## THIRD TASK : 
In this task we seek to use two models already generated in order to compare the translation capabilities.

For this task we have two datasets which have the same content but in different languages (English and Spanish). These documents will help us to determine the quality of the translation made by the models by comparing the result of the translation with the original.

For this reason, we have chosen to take 3 models from the appis page https://rapidapi.com/search/translate, this page allows us to use models for free, although there is a limit derived from the test that is available, although it is more enough for what you want to do. However, it is required to contract the service, although I emphasize that we will use the free mode.

To do this, the following steps must be followed for each of the models since we must place our keys and credentials.

enter the pages:

https://rapidapi.com/gatzuma/api/deep-translate1/
https://rapidapi.com/haizibinbin-owyntKc0a48/api/ai-translate/pricing
https://rapidapi.com/armangokka/api/translo/

When entering each of the links we can see a sale, where we will have to select pricing

Next, a screen will be observed where we have to subscribe for free to the most basic plan of each of the apps.

Subsequently we will have to return to the first page and select the option python -> requests here we can find our keys

These keys must be replaced as follows:

Deep Learning - translator_1
Translo - translator_2
ai-translate - translator_3
